IPL Player Performance & Social Network Analysis 🏏📊
Overview
This project analyzes IPL (Indian Premier League) player statistics using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Social Network Analysis (SNA). The goal is to uncover patterns in player performance, loyalty to teams, and the impact of salary on consistency. Using Python and Gephi, we visualize relationships and trends to gain meaningful insights.

Dataset
The dataset consists of key player statistics across multiple IPL seasons, including:

Player Name
Team(s) Played For
Years Played
Matches Played
Runs Scored & Highest Score
Salary (Auction Price)
Key Analysis & Insights
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
✅ Player Performance Metrics – Evaluated runs, matches, and highest scores.
✅ Salary vs. Performance – Analyzed how pay impacts player consistency.
✅ Data Visualization – Used histograms, box plots, and scatter plots to explore trends.

2. Social Network Analysis (SNA) using Gephi
✅ Player-Team Loyalty – Identified players who stayed with a franchise for years vs. frequent movers.
✅ Network Relationships – Explored player connections across teams and seasons.
✅ Impact on Performance – Found that loyal players tend to perform more consistently.

3. Findings
Higher salaries do not always guarantee better performance; only a few players thrive under high pressure.
Loyal players (e.g., Virat Kohli, MS Dhoni) tend to show steady growth, while frequent movers face fluctuating performance.
Network analysis reveals strong player-franchise bonds, impacting stability and success.
